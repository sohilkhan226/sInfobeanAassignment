# QNO 7:
#  Advanced Smart Chat Compression Expansion System

# A messaging application stores repeated characters in compressed form to
# reduce storage space. Before displaying messages to users, the system
# should reconstruct the original message.

# The application team has introduced additional rules.

# Conditions: - Alphabet followed by number - Repeat character according
# to the number - If alphabet is uppercase convert expanded characters
# into lowercase - Ignore special symbols - Display expanded string -
# Display total character count

# Test Case 1 Input: Enter compressed message: a3

# Output: Expanded Message: aaa

# Total Characters: 3

# Test Case 2 Input: Enter compressed message: A4b5

# Output: Expanded Message: aaaabbbbb

# Total Characters: 9

# Test Case 3 Input: Enter compressed message: x2Y3

# Output: Expanded Message: xxyyy

# Total Characters: 5

# Test Case 4 Input: Enter compressed message: m5@n2P4

# Output: Expanded Message: mmmmmnnpppp

# Total Characters: 11

# Test Case 5 Input: Enter compressed message: R3S2t5

# Output: Expanded Message: rrrssttttt

# Total Characters: 10

# **13. Number Range Display System (if-elif with loops)**
# A number analysis tool processes two input values and displays numbers between them based on their relationship.

# * If the first number is less than the second, display numbers in ascending order
# * If the first number is greater than the second, display numbers in descending order
# * If both numbers are equal, display "Both numbers are same"

# Write a program using **if-elif-else and loops** to implement this logic.

# Input: 5, 10
# Output: 5 6 7 8 9 10

# Input: 10, 5
# Output: 10 9 8 7 6 5

# Input: 7, 7
# Output: Both numbers are same

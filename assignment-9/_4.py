# 4. Airline Ticket Pricing Engine

# An airline calculates ticket price based on class, distance, and booking time.

# If class is business, then check distance. If distance is greater than 1000, price is 8000; otherwise 5000.

# If class is economy, then check distance. If distance is greater than 1000, then check booking time. If booking is early, price is 4000; otherwise 5000. If distance is less than or equal to 1000, price is 2500.

# Input:
# Class = economy
# Distance = 1200
# Booking = early

# Output:
# Ticket Price = 4000

distance     = int(input("Enter distance: "))
booking      = input("Enter booking time (early/late): ").lower()

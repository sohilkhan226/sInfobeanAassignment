# Assignment 8: Simple Interest Calculator
# ========================================

# A bank wants to help customers calculate the simple interest on their savings.

# Write a Python program that:
# - Accepts principal amount, rate of interest, and time (in years) as input.
# - Calculates the simple interest using the formula:
#   SI = (P × R × T) / 100
# - Displays the simple interest.

# Example:
# Principal = 1000
# Rate = 5
# Time = 2
# Simple Interest = 100.0

principal = float(input("Enter principal amount: "))
rate = float(input("Enter rate of interest: "))
time = float(input("Enter time in years: "))

si = (principal * rate * time) / 100

print("Simple Interest =", si)

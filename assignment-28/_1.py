# 1. Remove All Special Characters from a String

# Online Banking Customer Data Cleaning System

# A private bank has launched a new online account opening portal. While entering customer details, many users accidentally type unnecessary symbols, emojis, hashtags, dollar signs, and special characters in their names and addresses.

# Before storing the data into the database, the bank wants a Python program that removes all unwanted special characters and keeps only:

# * Alphabets
# * Numbers
# * Spaces

# The cleaned value should be stored back into the original string variable.

# Input:

# Deepika@@ Padukone!! 123
# Output:
# Deepika Padukone 123
# Input:
# Ajay###Singh$$$
# Output:
# AjaySingh


text = input()

cleaned = ""

for ch in text:
    if ch.isalnum() or ch == " ":
        cleaned += ch

text = cleaned
print(text)

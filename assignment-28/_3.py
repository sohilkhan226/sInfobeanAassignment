# 3. Find the First Non-Repeated Character

# Railway Ticket Fraud Detection System

# The railway department generates ticket reference IDs automatically.

# Sometimes, due to technical issues, many characters get repeated inside the ticket ID.

# The department wants a Python program that finds the first character that appears only once in the string.

# Example 1

# Input:
# aabbccddefg
# Output:

# ```
# e
# ```

text = input()

for ch in text:
    if text.lower().count(ch.lower()) == 1:
        print(ch)
        break
else:
    print("No non-repeated character found")

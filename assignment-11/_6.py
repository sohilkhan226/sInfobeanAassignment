# 6. Sum of Factors
# A puzzle-based game rewards users based on the sum of all factors of a chosen number.
# The system calculates the total score using all factors of the entered number.
# Write a program to find sum of factors using loops.

# Input:
# 6

# Output:
# Sum = 12

num = int(input("Enter number: "))
total = 0

for i in range(1, num + 1):
    if num % i == 0:
        total += i

print("Sum =", total)

#
# num = int(input("Enter number: "))
# total = 0
# i = 1

# while i <= num:
#     if num % i == 0:
#         total += i
#     i += 1

# print("Sum =", total)

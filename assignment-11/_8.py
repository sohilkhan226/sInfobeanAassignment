# 8. Count Multiples of 5 Between Two Numbers
# A supermarket gives coupons to customers whose token numbers are multiples of 5. The manager enters a token range and wants to know how many eligible token numbers exist.
# Write a program to count numbers divisible by 5 between two given numbers using loops.

# Input:
# 1 20

# Output:
# Count = 4

start = int(input("Enter start: "))
end = int(input("Enter end: "))
count = 0

for i in range(start, end + 1):
    if i % 5 == 0:
        count += 1

print("Count =", count)

#

# start = int(input("Enter start: "))
# end = int(input("Enter end: "))
# count = 0
# i = start

# while i <= end:
#     if i % 5 == 0:
#         count += 1
#     i += 1

# print("Count =", count)

# Strong Number Detector

# A banking security system uses Strong Numbers for special authentication testing.
# The user enters a range of numbers.
# The system identifies all Strong Numbers between the given range using nested loops.

# A Strong Number is a number in which the sum of factorials of its digits is equal to the original number.

# Example:
# 145

# 1! + 4! + 5!
# = 1 + 24 + 120
# = 145

# Since the sum is equal to the original number, 145 is called a Strong Number.

# Input:
# Enter starting number: 1
# Enter ending number: 500

# Output:
# Strong Numbers are:
# 1
# 2
# 145



start = int(input("Enter starting number: "))
end = int(input("Enter ending number: "))

print("Strong Numbers are:")

for num in range(start, end + 1):
    temp = num
    total = 0

    for _ in str(num):
        digit = temp % 10
        fact = 1
        for j in range(1, digit + 1):
            fact *= j
        total += fact
        temp //= 10

    if total == num:
        print(num)

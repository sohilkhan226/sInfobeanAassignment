# 8.
# Online Exam Result Processing System

# An online examination system stores marks of multiple classes.
# Each class contains multiple students, and each student has marks for multiple subjects.

# The program should use:
# - First loop for classes
# - Second loop for students
# - Third loop for subjects

# The system calculates total marks of every student.

# Input:
# Enter number of classes: 2
# Enter students per class: 2
# Enter subjects per student: 3

# Class 1

# Student 1
# Enter mark: 70
# Enter mark: 80
# Enter mark: 90

# Student 2
# Enter mark: 60
# Enter mark: 75
# Enter mark: 85

# Class 2

# Student 1
# Enter mark: 88
# Enter mark: 77
# Enter mark: 66

# Student 2
# Enter mark: 90
# Enter mark: 92
# Enter mark: 95

# Output:
# Class 1
# Student 1 Total = 240
# Student 2 Total = 220

# Class 2
# Student 1 Total = 231
# Student 2 Total = 277

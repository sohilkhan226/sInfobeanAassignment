# 1. Electricity Department Billing System


# The electricity department of a city wants to automate the monthly bill generation process for its customers. The bill is calculated based on slab-wise unit consumption:

# * First 100 units are charged at ₹5 per unit
# * Next 100 units (101–200) are charged at ₹7 per unit
# * Units above 200 are charged at ₹10 per unit

# Write a Python program to calculate the total electricity bill based on the number of units consumed.

# Input:
# Enter units consumed: 250

# Output:
# Total Electricity Bill: ₹1950

units = int(input("Enter units consumed: "))

if units <= 100:
    bill = units * 5
elif units <= 200:
    bill = (100 * 5) + (units - 100) * 7
else:
    bill = (100 * 5) + (100 * 7) + (units - 200) * 10

print("Total Electricity Bill: ₹" + str(bill))

# 7. Banking Withdrawal Limit System


# A bank wants to set withdrawal limits based on the available account balance:

# * Balance less than ₹1000 → Withdrawal not allowed
# * ₹1000 to ₹5000 → Maximum withdrawal ₹1000
# * Above ₹5000 → Maximum withdrawal ₹5000

# Write a Python program to display the withdrawal limit.

# Input:
# Enter account balance: 3500

# Output:
# Maximum Withdrawal Limit: ₹1000

balance = float(input("Enter account balance: "))

if balance < 1000:
    limit = "Withdrawal Not Allowed"
elif balance <= 5000:
    limit = "₹1000"
else:
    limit = "₹5000"

if balance < 1000:
    print("Maximum Withdrawal Limit:", limit)
else:
    print("Maximum Withdrawal Limit:", limit)

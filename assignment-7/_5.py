# 5. Cinema Ticket Booking System


# A cinema hall charges ticket prices based on the age of the customer:

# * Children (below 12 years) → ₹100
# * Adults (12 to 60 years) → ₹200
# * Senior citizens (above 60 years) → ₹150

# Write a Python program to determine the ticket price.

# Input:
# Enter age: 10

# Output:
# Ticket Price: ₹100

age = int(input("Enter age: "))

if age < 12:
    price = 100
elif age <= 60:
    price = 200
else:
    price = 150

print("Ticket Price: ₹" + str(price))

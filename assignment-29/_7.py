# Customer Feedback Analysis System

# An e-commerce company receives thousands of customer reviews every day for its products.

# To analyze customer opinions efficiently, the analytics team wants a Python program that counts how many times each word appears in a review message.

# This helps the company identify frequently used words such as:

# good
# bad
# delivery
# quality
# service

# Write a Python program to count the frequency of every word in a given sentence.

# Input:
# delivery was fast and delivery service was good
# Output:
# delivery : 2
# was : 2
# fast : 1
# and : 1
# service : 1
# good : 1



sentence = input("Enter sentence: ")

words = sentence.split()
freq = {}
order = []

for word in words:
    if word in freq:
        freq[word] += 1
    else:
        freq[word] = 1
        order.append(word)

for word in order:
    print(word, ":", freq[word])

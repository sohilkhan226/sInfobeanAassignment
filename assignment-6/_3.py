# 3. A smart electricity monitoring system categorizes usage levels for better energy management. 
# The system should take the number of units consumed as input. If the units are greater than or equal to 100, then check further.
#  If the units are greater than or equal to 300, assign "High Usage". Otherwise, check again. 
# If the units are greater than or equal to 200, assign "Moderate Usage"; otherwise, assign "Normal Usage".
#  If the units are less than 100, assign "Low Usage". Display the usage category.

# Input:
# Units = 220

# Output:
# Usage Category = Moderate Usage

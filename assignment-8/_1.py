# 1. Insurance Claim Approval System

# An insurance company processes claims based on policy age, claim amount, and accident type. The approval depends on multiple levels of verification to reduce fraud.

# If the policy age is at least 2 years, then check the claim amount. If the claim amount is up to 50000, then check the accident type. If it is minor, approve the claim; otherwise, approve it with inspection. If the claim amount is between 50001 and 200000, then check the accident type. If it is major, approve with investigation; otherwise reject. If the claim amount exceeds 200000, reject. If the policy age is less than 2 years, then check accident type. If minor, reject; otherwise mark as pending review.

# Input:
# Policy Age = 3
# Claim Amount = 120000
# Accident Type = major

# Output:
# Claim Status = Approved with Investigation

policy_age = int(input("Enter policy age: "))
claim_amount = int(input("Enter claim amount: "))
